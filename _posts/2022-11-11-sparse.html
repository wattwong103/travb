<h2><div align=center>Sparse-view Cone Beam CT Reconstruction using Data-consistent Supervised and Adversarial Learning from Scarce Training Data </div></h2>

<h3 class="section-heading">Abstract</h3>

<p>Reconstruction of CT images from a limited set of projections through an object is important in several applications ranging from medical imaging to industrial settings.
As the number of available projections decreases, traditional reconstruction techniques such as the Feldkamp, Davis, and Kress (FDK) algorithm and model based iterative reconstruction methods perform poorly. </p>

<p>This work focuses on image reconstruction in such settings, namely, when both the number of available CT projections and the training data is extremely
limited. We adopt a sequential reconstruction approach over several stages using an adversarially trained shallow network for "destreaking" followed by a data-consistency update in each
stage. We use image subvolumes to train our method and patch aggregation and a hybrid 3D-to-2D mapping network for the "destreaking" component. Comparisons
to other methods over several test examples indicate that the proposed method has much potential when both the number of projections and available training data are highly limited.</p>
