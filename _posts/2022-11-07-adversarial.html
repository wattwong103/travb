<h3 class="section-heading"><div align=center>SMUG: Towards Robust MRI Reconstruction by Smoothed Unrolling</div></h3>

<p>Although deep learning (DL) has gained much popularity for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), recent studies have shown that DL-based MRI reconstruction models could be over-sensitive to  tiny input perturbations (that are called `adversarial perturbations'), which cause unstable, low-quality reconstructed images. 
    This raises the question of how to design robust DL methods for  MRI reconstruction. 
    To address this problem, we propose  a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed  Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning operation. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense for image classification. Yet, we find that  the conventional design that applies RS to  the entire DL process is ineffective for  MRI reconstruction. We show that SMUG addresses the above issue by customizing the RS operation based on the unrolling  architecture  of the DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to   the vanilla RS approach and several variants of SMUG,  we show that 
    SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of  perturbation sources, including perturbations to input measurements, different measurement sampling rates, and different unrolling steps.
