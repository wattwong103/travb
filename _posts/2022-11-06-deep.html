<h3 class="section-heading">Abstract</h3>

<p>Traditional model-based image reconstruction
    (MBIR) methods combine forward and noise models with simple
    object priors. In this
        work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised (SUPER) learning
        framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT) image
        reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages
        both sparsity or unsupervised learning-based priors and neural
        network reconstructors to simulate a fixed-point iteration
        process. Each proposed trained block consists of a deterministic
        MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in
        parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally
        combined, and multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a
        reconstruction pipeline. </p>

        <p>We demonstrate the efficacy of this
        learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image reconstruction
        with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo
        Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and
        testing. In our experiments, we study combinations of supervised
        deep network reconstructors and sparse representations-based
        (unsupervised) learned or analytical priors. Our results
        demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
        framework compared to recent reconstruction methods.</p>
