# How to update the TBRG website

You do not need to know Git, YAML, or coding. After the new site is published, this is the usual way to change it.

## Before you start

Someone with access to the GitHub repository (`wattwong103/travb`) must invite you as a collaborator once. You will log in with that GitHub account.

## Everyday editing

1. Open [the editor](https://wattwong103.github.io/travb/admin/).
2. Click **Login with GitHub** and approve access.
3. Choose a section (Faculty, Students, Publications, News, Home slides, or Blog posts).
4. Change the fields (or click **Add** for a new person, paper, news item, slide, or post).
5. Click **Save** / **Publish**.
6. Wait one or two minutes, then refresh the public site: https://wattwong103.github.io/travb

### What each section is for

| Section | Use it for |
|---|---|
| Faculty | Names, roles, emails, photos, short bios |
| Students | Student names and emails |
| Publications | Paper title, authors, short description, DOI/link |
| News | Date + one headline |
| Home slides | Homepage banners (image optional; title and caption) |
| Blog posts | Longer notes. Short announcements stay in News. |

Photos: upload a square-ish portrait. It will show on the People page.

If a name or email looks like a placeholder (`xxxxx`, or a last name that is just `X`), the public site hides that person on purpose.

Home slides: leave the image blank for a type-only banner. Do not reuse leftover Cambridge photos (`materials.jpg`, `printer-fleet.jpg`).

## If “Login with GitHub” does not work

The editor needs a one-time GitHub login app (OAuth). That is a maintainer job, not something professors should set up. Until it is done, use the backup below.

### Backup: edit in the GitHub website

You must be logged into GitHub. Click a link, then the pencil icon, then **Commit changes**.

- [News](https://github.com/wattwong103/travb/edit/main/_data/news.yml)
- [Publications](https://github.com/wattwong103/travb/edit/main/_data/publist.yml)
- [Faculty](https://github.com/wattwong103/travb/edit/main/_data/team_members.yml)
- [Students](https://github.com/wattwong103/travb/edit/main/_data/students.yml)
- [Home slides](https://github.com/wattwong103/travb/edit/main/_data/slides.yml)
- [Blog posts](https://github.com/wattwong103/travb/tree/main/_posts)

Copy an existing block and change the text. Keep the dashes and spacing the same.

## Maintainer note (not for everyday editors)

GitHub backend for Decap CMS needs a GitHub OAuth App plus a tiny auth callback (for example the [Decap GitHub OAuth provider](https://github.com/vencax/netlify-cms-github-oauth-provider) or a Cloudflare Worker). Homepage URL: `https://wattwong103.github.io/travb`. Then set `backend.base_url` in `admin/config.yml` to that callback origin. Professors do not do this step.
