The Travel Behavior Research Group (TBRG) is based at the [Department of Civil Engineering](https://civil.eng.chula.ac.th/web/) at [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/). Our research aims to uncover the underlying factors influencing how individuals make travel decisions, the impact of these choices on transportation systems, and the broader implications for urban planning and policy. By integrating insights from fields such as transportation engineering, urban studies, psychology, and economics, TBRG seeks to develop innovative solutions that enhance mobility, reduce congestion, and promote sustainable travel practices.

The group is working on:

**Transportation Engineering**  
Focuses on the design, construction, and maintenance of transportation systems. We aims to ensure safe, efficient, and sustainable movement of people and goods.

**Travel Behavior Surveys & Analysis**  
Collects and examines data on how people travel, including their mode choices, travel times, and trip purposes. This research helps understand travel patterns and preferences, informing policies and strategies to improve transportation systems.

**Transportation Planning**  
Develops strategies and plans to meet current and future transportation needs. It involves assessing existing transportation networks, forecasting future demands, and designing projects that enhance mobility and accessibility.
