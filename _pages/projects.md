# Current Projects

The Travel Behavior Research Group is actively engaged in multiple research projects that advance our understanding of transportation systems and human mobility patterns. Our projects integrate cutting-edge methodologies from transportation engineering, behavioral science, and data analytics to address real-world transportation challenges.

## Our Research Focus

Our team conducts interdisciplinary research that bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application. We work closely with government agencies, transportation authorities, and international partners to ensure our research addresses pressing societal needs and contributes to evidence-based policy making.

### Active Research Projects

**Urban Mobility Pattern Analysis in Bangkok Metropolitan Region**  
Comprehensive study examining travel behavior patterns, mode choice decisions, and mobility trends across different demographic groups in the Bangkok metropolitan area. This project involves large-scale survey data collection and advanced statistical modeling techniques.

**Public Transportation Accessibility and Equity Assessment**  
Investigation of public transportation accessibility across different socioeconomic areas in Bangkok, focusing on identifying gaps in service coverage and developing recommendations for more equitable transportation planning.

**Travel Behavior Response to Transportation Policy Interventions**  
Longitudinal study examining how individuals and households adapt their travel behavior in response to new transportation policies, infrastructure developments, and service changes.

**Highway Safety Enhancement through Behavioral Analysis**  
*In collaboration with Highway Technology Operation Center (HTOC) and King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL)*  
Research project focused on understanding driver behavior patterns and developing data-driven strategies to improve highway safety across Thailand's transportation network.

**Sustainable Transportation Mode Choice Modeling**  
Development of advanced choice models that incorporate environmental consciousness, social factors, and economic considerations in transportation mode selection decisions.

**Digital Transportation Planning Tools Development**  
Creation of computational tools and software applications that support evidence-based transportation planning and policy evaluation for local planning agencies.

**Post-Pandemic Travel Behavior Evolution**  
Ongoing research examining how the COVID-19 pandemic has permanently altered travel patterns, work commuting behaviors, and transportation service demands in urban areas.

**Smart Mobility and Technology Adoption Study**  
Investigation of how emerging technologies, including ride-sharing services, electric vehicles, and mobility-as-a-service platforms, are influencing traditional travel behavior patterns.

**Regional Transportation Connectivity Analysis**  
Multi-scale analysis of transportation connectivity between Bangkok and surrounding provinces, examining intercity travel patterns and infrastructure development needs.

**Community-Based Transportation Planning Research**  
Participatory research approaches that engage local communities in transportation planning processes, focusing on understanding grassroots mobility needs and preferences.

## Research Methodology

Our projects employ a diverse range of research methodologies including:

- Large-scale household travel surveys and interviews
- Revealed and stated preference studies
- Advanced statistical and econometric modeling
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis
- Traffic simulation and optimization techniques
- Participatory planning and community engagement methods
- Big data analytics and machine learning applications

## Project Outcomes and Impact

Our research contributes to the transportation field through academic publications, policy recommendations, planning tool development, and direct consultation with government agencies and transportation organizations. We are committed to translating research findings into practical solutions that improve transportation systems and quality of life for communities.
