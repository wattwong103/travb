## Research

The Travel Behavior Research Group integrates transportation engineering, behavioral psychology, data science, and urban planning to understand complex mobility patterns and develop evidence-based solutions that enhance transportation systems, promote sustainable travel choices, and improve accessibility for diverse populations across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

**Mobility pattern analysis** Understanding how people move through urban and rural environments using GPS tracking, mobile data, and machine learning to identify travel behaviors and preferences.

**Transportation choice modeling** Developing predictive models that explain why people choose specific modes of transport, routes, and travel times based on personal, social, and environmental factors.

**Smart mobility systems** Integrating behavioral insights with emerging transportation technologies like autonomous vehicles, shared mobility, and multimodal planning platforms to enhance user experience and system efficiency.

**Travel demand forecasting** Creating advanced models to predict future transportation needs using demographic trends, land use patterns, and behavioral change indicators for infrastructure planning.

**Sustainable transportation behavior** Investigating factors that influence adoption of eco-friendly travel modes and designing interventions to promote low-carbon mobility choices.

**Transportation equity and accessibility** Analyzing how transportation systems serve different socioeconomic groups and developing strategies to improve mobility access for underserved communities.
